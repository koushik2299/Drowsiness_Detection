# Project Summary: Detecting Drowsy Drivers using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning

## Introduction:
The objective of our project was to address the critical issue of identifying drowsy drivers using images captured during driving. Drowsy driving poses a significant risk to road safety, and our project aimed to develop an effective solution using deep learning techniques.

## Data Preprocessing:
We began by preparing our dataset for model training. Comprehensive data preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, was performed to ensure that our model could learn effectively from the images.

## Model Selection and Transfer Learning:
In pursuit of robust and accurate results, we employed transfer learning, a powerful technique in deep learning. We selected two renowned pre-trained models, ResNet-50 and MobileNet, as the foundations of our architectures. These models had been trained on large datasets and were well-suited for feature extraction.

## Enhancing Model Architectures:
To tailor the models to our specific problem, we introduced additional layers after the pre-trained base. This enhancement aimed to improve the models' capabilities in capturing intricate patterns and relationships within the driving images. Our architecture refinements were designed to optimize performance and adapt the models to our drowsy driver detection task.

## Evaluation and Results:
After training and fine-tuning the models, we rigorously evaluated their performance. Our ResNet-50 model achieved an impressive 80% accuracy, demonstrating its competence in discerning drowsy drivers from the images. Furthermore, our MobileNet-based model exhibited remarkable accuracy of 98%, showcasing the potency of transfer learning and our architectural enhancements.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, our project successfully tackled the critical problem of identifying drowsy drivers using deep learning techniques. Through meticulous data preprocessing, strategic model selection, and architectural refinements, we achieved remarkable accuracy levels. Our work contributes to road safety and underscores the efficacy of leveraging transfer learning and model customization for real-world applications.
